# What Is A Work Order? How It Benefits Your Organization

A work order serves as a formal request for maintenance, repair, or operational tasks. It encompasses essential information about the maintenance task and provides a clear process for its completion. This document may also entail details about job authorization, assignees, expected outcomes, and any unique instructions or specifications. Think of work orders as the driving force behind your maintenance operations, facilitating seamless task execution and efficient workflow management.

Work orders can be generated through a service request form (work request form) that is submitted by a staff member, customer, or tenant or automatically created through work order management software, such as a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS).  Using CMMS software to manage work orders provides additional information to technicians, checklists, access to documents, manuals, images, and more.   In addition to the documentation of the tasks that were performed, labor expenses, materials issued from inventory, spot buys, and other expenses incurred for the job can also be captured within the work order.

What Is The Purpose Of A Work Order? Why Are Work Orders Important? 
Top

The purpose of a work order is to initiate a task, clarify what is to be done, specify completion dates, and give special instructions as needed.  CMMS work order management software also helps organizations manage and maintain data on assets as well as on resources, expenses, and labor.  Organizations have the flexibility to manage and schedule current and upcoming work, analyze data to make improvements, manage expenses, control labor costs, and remain compliant.

Service Requests (Work Requests) vs Work Orders
Top

A Service Request (also referred to as a Work Request) is a request for a maintenance task that is submitted by a non-maintenance staff member or customer.  When a service request is approved by the maintenance manager, they will assign a technician and schedule the task, and a work order is created.

A Work Order is authorization for the maintenance team to perform the maintenance task.

What Is The Work Order Process

Using CMMS software makes the work order management process more efficient and streamlined.  Some of the main components of a work order include creation, completion, and recording.  

The process:

What Are The Different Types Of Work Orders?
Top

Standard Work Order
A standard work order is a non-critical maintenance task that does not pose an immediate risk to facilities, systems, equipment or components. Some examples are: removing old equipment, setting up new equipment, painting, or changing light bulbs.

Preventive Maintenance
A preventive maintenance work order is an essential tool for organizations looking to ensure the effectiveness of their equipment as well as to extend the life of their assets. This work order gives users the ability to schedule routine maintenance tasks on assets and equipment to minimize unexpected breakdowns. The preventive maintenance work order gives users the ability to control, plan, schedule, and identify the materials, parts, and labor to do the work within a specific timeframe. The advantages of preventive maintenance are to keep existing equipment in good working condition, prevent equipment downtime, increase the life expectancy of assets, decrease the number of major repairs, and control expenses.

Prepare for Inspections
When creating a work order, you can create a checklist and define a set of inspection points requiring a maintenance technician to audit or inspect an asset based on that predetermined set of parameters.  If the technician should identify a problem during the inspection, then a new work order can be created to correct that problem.

Reactive\Emergency
A reactive or emergency work order is generated when equipment breakdowns or a facility failure occurs and creates an unsafe environment, or a critical asset needs to be repaired immediately. An emergency work order is used to record and track and document any unscheduled work.  Reactive work orders give maintenance technicians the ability to provide detailed information on what caused the breakdown, what actions were taken to fix it, and what can be done to prevent it in the future.

Corrective Maintenance
A corrective maintenance work order is generated as a result of a regular inspection, preventive maintenance, emergency, etc., which identifies the failure in a reasonable time for corrective maintenance to be planned and scheduled.
