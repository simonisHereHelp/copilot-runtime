The Medical Device User Fee Cover Sheet is required for your Medical Device Application Submission. After completing the cover sheet, you will be assigned a unique user fee payment identification number that distinguishes and tracks your fee payment and submission.

How to Fill Out the MDUFA User Fee Cover Sheet On-line:
FDA offers your organization the ability to complete a Medical Device User Fee Cover Sheet online and submit it electronically.

Read the instructions below and then go to Create MDUFA User Fee Cover Sheet to fill out the form.

1. You will register on-line by providing the following information:

One of the following: Employer Identification Number (EIN), Dun & Bradstreet Number (DUNS), or Organization Number
Contact Name
Company Name
Address
City
State
Zip Code
Country
Telephone
Fax
E-mail
EIN numbers are required for U.S. firms, and DUNS numbers are required for foreign firms. You will need to have an EIN or DUNS number to create a User Fee account and proceed with registration. If you have previously registered with the FDA User Fee System for an ADUFA or PDUFA cover sheet, you will have been issued an Organization ID number (Org ID). The Org ID uniquely identifies your organization to the FDA. You will need one of these three numbers to proceed with registration.

2. Fill out the Medical Device User Fee Cover Sheet. Please answer a series of questions regarding the type of application being submitted for FDA's review. You will have the opportunity to view the cover sheet in draft form before submitting it to FDA.

3. When you are done, click the SUBMIT button to complete the cover sheet submission process. A form will appear with an electronically generated user fee payment identification number that is located in the upper right-hand corner, beginning with the letters MD. This number will assist FDA in tracking your payment and submission for the review process.
